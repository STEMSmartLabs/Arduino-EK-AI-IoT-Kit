## Overview

The **Arduino AI/IoT Kit** is designed to help you get started with AI and Machine Learning using the Arduino Ek R4 WiFi and a suite of onboard & Grove-compatible sensors. It supports both on-device (TinyML) inference and cloud-based AI integrations, enabling low-latency edge projects as well as remote monitoring and control.

## What Is the Arduino AI/IoT Kit?

The Arduino AI/IoT Kit is a next-generation learning platform that introduces students and enthusiasts to AI and ML through hands-on experiments and real sensor data. It‚Äôs built around the Arduino Ek R4 WiFi board and includes everything you need to explore TinyML and cloud-connected applications.

## Introduction to Machine Learning with Arduino

Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Machine Learning (ML), lets devices ‚Äúlearn‚Äù patterns from data instead of relying solely on pre-programmed logic. With ML on Arduino, you can train models on datasets and run inference‚Äîrecognizing gestures, classifying sounds, or detecting anomalies‚Äîdirectly on the board or in the cloud.

---

## Key Concepts in ML

- **Training**: Teaching a model using a labeled dataset.  
- **Inference**: Using a trained model to make predictions on new data.  
- **Features**: Attributes or patterns extracted from raw sensor readings.  
- **Models**: Mathematical representations of learned patterns.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Gesture Recognition**: Detect specific movements via accelerometer data.  
- **Sound Classification**: Identify claps, voice commands, barking, etc.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spot unusual patterns in environmental or system data.

---

## Arduino and ML Integration

1. **Data Collection**: Capture sensor data on the Arduino.  
2. **Model Training**: Use platforms like Edge Impulse to train and optimize TinyML models.  
3. **Export & Deploy**: Generate an Arduino library from your trained model and include it in your sketch.  
4. **Inference**: Run real-time predictions on the board or push data to cloud AI services for advanced processing.

---

## Example Applications

- **Voice-Controlled Projects**: Speech recognition to drive actions on Arduino.  
- **Predictive Systems**: Analyze sensor streams for forecasting (e.g., weather).  
- **Interactive Displays**: Generate dynamic content for OLEDs or web dashboards.

## Gesture Recognition Example

![Gesture Recognition Example](https://shop.stemsmartlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wifi_board_accelerometer.jpg)
 

An end-to-end project showing how to recognize hand gestures with TinyML.

### Requirements

- Arduino AI/IoT Kit  
- USB-C¬Æ Cable  
- Edge Impulse Arduino Library

### Option 1: Train Your Own Model

1. **Collect Data**  
   - Record accelerometer readings in Edge Impulse‚Äôs Data Acquisition tool.  
2. **Train Model**  
   - Define classes (circle, up-down, left-right) and train on your dataset.  
3. **Export Library**  
   - Generate an Arduino library (.zip) from Edge Impulse.  
4. **Deploy**  
   - Add the .zip via **Sketch ‚Üí Add .ZIP Library‚Ä¶** and include it in your code.

### Option 2: Use the Pre-Trained Model

1. **Download** our pre-trained library (including `movement_model.zip`) from this repo.
2. **Install** via **Sketch ‚Üí Include Library ‚Üí Add .ZIP Library‚Ä¶**.
3. **Include** it in your sketch and upload.

### How It Works

- Reads live accelerometer data.  
- Converts raw readings into feature vectors.  
- Runs inference with the TinyML model.  
- Outputs gesture predictions to the Serial Monitor for integration into your projects.

## Setting Up Arduino IoT Cloud

Objective: Connect your kit to Arduino IoT Cloud for remote data logging & device management.

### Create / Log In

1. Go to [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) and sign in with your Arduino ID.  
2. Install the desktop **Arduino Create Agent** when prompted.

### Add Your Device

1. Click **+ Add Device ‚Üí Arduino ‚Üí UNO R4 WiFi**.  
2. Follow the wizard to register your board and enter WiFi credentials.

### Create a ‚ÄúThing‚Äù & Define Variables

- temperature  
- humidity  
- LED  
- NeoPixel  
- Servo Motor  
- Switch

## Building Your First IoT Dashboard

1. Open the **Dashboard** tab and **Create Dashboard**.  
2. Add widgets: **Gauges**, **Graphs**, **Switches**, **Text Labels**.  
3. Bind widgets to your cloud variables.  
4. Monitor live data via web or the Arduino IoT Remote mobile app.  
5. **Automate Actions**: e.g., turn on a fan widget when `temperature > 30 ¬∞C`.

## Integrating AI + IoT

Objective: Combine TinyML inference with cloud connectivity.

### Workflow

1. **Train** ML model on Edge Impulse.  
2. **Deploy** to UNO R4 WiFi.  
3. **Infer** locally and push predictions to cloud variables.  
4. **Visualize** results on your IoT dashboard.

### Sample Use Case ‚Äì Sound Detection Model

- **Sensor**: Grove Microphone  
- **Classes**: Barking, Clapping, Silence  
- **Action**: Display detected class on dashboard and send a push notification when ‚ÄúBarking‚Äù persists > 3 s.
